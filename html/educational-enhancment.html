    <h1>EDUCATIONAL ENHANCMENT</h1>

    <pre>
           I have been into computer science my whole life from when I was a kid
        playing video games or coding my first app. I've always found interest in
        this new technology thats taking the world by storm. I first figured out my
        love for video games when I got a "Wii u" for my 7th Birthday, which my first
        game happended to be "Super Mario Maker". I loved the fact that you could make
        your own challenges, for you and other people to face. This made me dive deaper
        into the field of tech and creating my own stuff, so I later got a xbox 360 and 
        began to play minecraft. From here I was watching youtube about mods and datapacks
        and how you could create these unique additions to the game through your own imagination.
        I later got ahold of a advanced studdent from Indian Hills Commuity College for a 1 on 1
        mentorship for help in creating my first app for my 4-H Club. At age 12 I qualified for the 
        Iowa State Fair and won a scholarship for Computer Science Classes there. I Later built my
        first PC at 13 and got deeper and deeper into tech.
